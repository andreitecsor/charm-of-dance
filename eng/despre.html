                        <h1><strong>«The Charm of Dance» International Festival

</strong></h1>
                      <h1><strong>8th edition – May 21th 2016</strong></h1>
                        
                      <p align="justify">„The Charm of Dance” started in 2009 as a festival and competition initiated by 

the Students' Council of „Alexandru Ioan Cuza” High School, whose members decided to 

organize a dance contest for the students who did not belong to vocational coreography 

schools.  The first six editions  were  coordinated by Florica Chiar, chemistry teacher,  helped 

by a team which included : Stelian Marin, Floriana Aurel, Mihaela Magureanu, Andra Pana, 

Valeria Gherghe, Florin Stănoiu, Catalin Micu, Florica Bogdan, Floricica Marin, all of them 

teachers at „Cuza”. Subsequently, the festival - the only event of  its kind taking place in 

southern Romania – has grown in scope and participation from one edition to another.</p> <br />

 <p align="justify">The 2015 event organizers' team,  coordinated by Florica Chiar, included the 

following members:  Marin Stelian. Valeria Gherghe, General Inspector with the Teleorman 

School Inspectorate, Florin-Viorel Stanoiu, Principal of „A. I Cuza”, Elena Serbanescu, 

School Inspector for educational programmes, Floriana Aurel from the Children's Palace, 

Eugen Delcea representing Alexandria Mayoralty and Anghel Tudor from The Banat 

Bulgarians'  Union  and the Teleorman Chapter of „Bulgarian Roots” </p><br />

<p align="justify">The supporting team included Catalin Micu deputy director of „A.I. Cuza”,  consultant 

Florea Ologeanu  from the Teleorman Center for Promoting and Preserving Traditional 

Cultural Heritage, Mariana Mitran, from the Teleorman County Division for Youth and Sports  

and teachers from „Cuza” :  Mariana Pavel, educational adviser, Florica Bogdan, Andra Pana, 

Florina Vasilescu, Daniela Martinescu, Floricica Marin, Tatiana Popescu, Marius Soare and 

Ion Sin, as well as student volunteers coordinated by Theodor Valcu Chairperson of the  

school's  Students' Council.</p>
<br />
<p align="justify">The first event, held in 2009, included 18 participating teams, all from Teleorman 

County, while the following edition counted 25 local teams  competing for the festival 

trophies. The 2011  competition brought together 35 groups of dancers from the counties of  

Dolj, Olt, Arges, Giurgiu and Teleorman,  while the 4th edition ( 2012) received international 

participation from Hungary, Bulgaria, The Republic of Moldova , as well as teams from the 

counties of Buzau, Braila, Maramures, Hunedoara, Olt and Teleorman.</p><br />

<p align="justify">The 5th edition included both national and international participation with dancers 

from Bulgaria, Teleorman and other Romanian regions (Deva, Buzău, Piteşti, Găeşti, Podul 

lloaiei – Iaşi, Cornetu – Ilfov). The 6th edition was international, with thirty participating 

teams from Romania and abroad.
</p><br />
<p align="justify">The 7th edition of the festival was also international with participants from 19 schools, 

Romanian and foreign, 350 dancers, 35 teachers as coaches, 8 teachers on the organizing 

team, 12 teachers on the support team, 25 participants from partner institutions, 70 student 

volunteers  and more than 200 students from Cuza among the spectators.</p><br />

<p align="justify">The Festival  took  a lot of effort in designing, implementing and developing a rich 

array of activities throughout its various stages: the initial preparations made by the 

organizers' project  team, launching the project, promoting and advertising the festival home 

and abroad, getting in touch with the potential participants, registration, selection of the 

registered teams, preparation of the publicity materials, arranging a retrospective photography 

exhibition  and  traditional folk costume displays and presentations,  decorating the venue,  

supervising the unfolding of the parade and competition, assessing and disseminating the 

project results ( All the participants received the festival's bilingual magazine and the digital 

recording of the whole event)</p><br />

<p align="justify">The competition comprises five sections : mixt folk dances, girls / boys folk dances, 

traditional national folk dances, modern dancing, ballroom dancing, cheerleaders/majorettes.</p><br />

<p align="justify">Our partners in this project were  Alexandria Mayoralty, The House of Culture of the 

Alexandria Municipality , The Teleorman School Inspectorate, Alexandria Children's Palace, 

The Teleorman County  Centre for the Preserving and Promoting the Traditional Cultural 

Heritage, The Parents' Representative Council of „A. I. Cuza” High School,  mass media,  as 

well as local sponsors : S.C. RECOND COM IMPEX SR, S.C. DAN MAR PROD S.R.L, 

S.C.GERMINO S.A., S.C. COMALAT NANOV S.A. </p><br />

          <p align="justify">In time, the competition enjoyed ever wider participation, due to more effective 

organization and promotion of the event. It also proved to be an excellent opportunity for the 

students to develop useful life skills such as good planning and communication abilities as 

well as team spirit. The festival has become a major event of the local community, with the 

opening parade and the competition performances receiving extensive coverage in the local 

press and TV stations. </p>

              <p align="justify">All things considered, we can proudly say that  „The Charm of Dance” International 

Festival is now a  well – established cultural event in our school's  and community's life, a 

challenging event which  creates high expectations for both participants and organizers . We 

thank you for accepting our invitation to be part of this wonderful experience and enjoy the 

unique charm of dance.
